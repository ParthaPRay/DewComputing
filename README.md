Abstract:
Since the end of the 1990s, the world has witnessed a tremendous growth in the area of information and communication technology (ICT), starting with grid computing, cloud computing (CC), and fog computing to recently introduced edge computing. Although, these technologies are still in very good shape, they do heavily rely on connectivity, i.e., Internet. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel dew-cloud architecture that brings the power of CC together with the dew computing (DC). Originally, the dew-cloud architecture is an extension of the existing client-server architecture, where two servers are placed at both ends of the communication link. With the help of a dew server, a user has more control and flexibility to access his/her personal data in the absence of an Internet connection. Primarily, the data are stored at the dew server as a local copy upon which instantiation of the Internet is synchronized with the master copy at the cloud side. Users can browse, read, write, or append data on the local dew site, which is a local Web form of an actual website. With the incorporation of the dew domain naming system and dew domain name redirection, mapping between different local dew sites has become possible. Novel services, such as infrastructure-as-a-dew, software-as-a-dew service, and software-as-a-dew product, are, hereby, introduced along with the DC. This paper presents the following as key contributions: 1) a precise and concrete definition of DC; 2) detailed and comprehensive discussions of its concept and working principle; 3) application potentials; and 4) technical challenges. The motto of this paper is to conceptualize the fact of empowerment of the ICT-user base with almost an Internet-free surfing experience in coming days.

Abstract
Since the inception of the internetwork facility, it has been continuously serving as the fundamental backbone of existing aspects, such as cloud, fog, and edge computing. Several application perspectives are in practice that mandate the involvement of application domains including smart retail, transportation, and data analytics. However, the deployed service platforms do not conform to facilitate the minimal and/or internetwork-free orientation to current paradigms. Hence, to cater this approach, a dew computing paradigm that goals at bringing cloud, fog, or edge resources and services to the nearest of user's periphery without or minimal use of internetwork has been introduced. This article advocates the feasibility, applicability, and appropriation of dew computing while leveraging several real-life case studies with special attention to internetwork-free movement. From earlier published literary works, a taxonomy has been devised in the dominion of dew computing. Moreover, highlights are made on selective requirements that would be key to the advancement of dew computing. Finally, challenges are discussed to provide future research directions in the dew computing domain.
